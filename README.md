# WeatherBot

### WeatherBot is an open source automated twitter bot that iteratively tweets out weather data. The default city is Troy, NY.

## Requirements
[Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy)

[Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/)

#### Future Plans
1. Include emergency alerts.
2. Automatic replies if you tweet certain weather queries to the bot.
3. If someone tweets another city name at the bot, it will send an automated direct message with weather updates for that city.
4. If someone Tweets just a city name such as “Troy”, the bot will send a direct message asking to select a city from a list (eg. Troy, NY or Troy, MI).
